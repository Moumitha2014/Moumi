    <h1>Favourite Garden Plants</h1>

    <h2>Succulents</h2>
    <img src="Images/Succulents.jpg" alt="succulents" width="225" />

    <p>
      succulents, are plants with parts that are thickened, fleshy, and
      engorged, usually to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. The
      habitats of these water-preserving plants are often in areas with high
      temperatures and low rainfall, such as deserts, but succulents may be
      found even in alpine ecosystems growing in rocky or sandy soil. Succulents
      are characterized by their ability to th Succulents are characterized by
      their ability to thrive on limited water sources, such as mist and dew,
      which makes them equipped to survive in ecosystems that contain scarce
      water sources.<br /><br />One common adaptation in many succulents is the
      timing of the opening of their stomata, which are small mouthlike
      structures on the surface of plant leaves and stems. Stomata allow for the
      uptake of carbon dioxide from the environment and the loss of water and
      oxygen to the environment. Unlike those of most plants, the stomata of
      many succulent plants are closed during the day and open at night. As a
      result, the loss of water during the hot dry daytime hours is minimized
      and carbon dioxide uptake occurs in the dark. These succulent plants,
      therefore, exhibit a modified form of CO2 fixation and photosynthesis
      called crassulacean acid metabolism.

    <h2>Cactus</h2>

    <p>
      Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Cacti are adapted to live
      in very dry environments, including the Atacama Desert, one of the driest
      places on Earth.Because of this, cacti show many adaptations to conserve
      water. For example, almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have
      thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water.In the absence of true
      leaves, cacti's enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis.Many cacti live in
      dry places, such as deserts , most cacti have sharp thorns and thick skin.
      <br /><br />There are many shapes and sizes of cacti. Some are short and
      round; others are tall and thin. Many cactus flowers are big and
      beautiful. Some bloom at night and are pollinated by moths and bats. Some
      cactus fruits are brightly coloured and good to eat: many animals eat
      cactus fruits.

    <h2>Flowering Plants</h2>

    <p>
      Flowering plants are plants that bear flowers and fruits, and form the
      clade Angiospermae.The term 'angiosperm' is derived from the Greek words
      angeion, meaning that the seeds are enclosed within a fruit. The group was
      formerly called Magnoliophyta.Angiosperms are by far the most diverse
      group of land plants with 64 orders, 416 families, approximately 13,000
      known genera and 300,000 known species. They include all forbs, grasses
      and grass-like plants, a vast majority of broad-leaved trees, shrubs and
      vines, and most aquatic plants.<br /><br />Agriculture is almost entirely
      dependent on angiosperms, and a small number of flowering plant families
      supply nearly all plant-based food and livestock feed. Rice, maize and
      wheat provide half of the world's staple calorie intake, and all three
      plants are cereals from the Poaceae family.Other families provide
      important industrial plant products such as wood, paper and cotton, and
      supply numerous ingredients for beverages, sugar production, traditional
      medicine and modern pharmaceuticals. Flowering plants are also commonly
      grown for decorative purposes, with certain flowers playing significant
      cultural roles in many societies.

    <h2>Shrubs</h2>
    <img src="Images/Shrubs.jpeg" alt="Shrubs" width="250" />
    <p>
      A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized perennial woody plant. Unlike
      herbaceous plants, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground.
      Shrubs can be either deciduous or evergreen. They are distinguished from
      trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6 to 7 feet
      tall.Small shrubs, less than 6.6 feet tall are sometimes termed as
      subshrubs. Many botanical groups have species that are shrubs, and others
      that are trees and herbaceous plants instead.<br /><br />Some define a
      shrub as less than 6 m and a tree as over 6 m. Others use 10 m as the
      cutoff point for classification.Many trees do not reach this mature height
      because of hostile, less than ideal growing conditions, and resemble
      shrub-sized plants. Others in such species have the potential to grow
      taller in ideal conditions. For longevity, most shrubs are classified
      between perennials and trees. Some only last about five years in good
      conditions. Others, usually larger and more woody, live beyond 70. On
      average, they die after eight years.
