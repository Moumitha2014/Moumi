          She debuted as a brutish strongwoman in 1944's Wonder Woman, written
          by Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston and illustrated by
          Harry G. Peter, and went on to become one of Wonder Woman's most
          recognizable and persistent foes, appearing during every major era of
          the hero's comic book adventures, and adapted frequently for
          television and animation.

        <p>
          Power Girl is the cousin of the superhero Superman, but from an
          alternate universe in the fictional multiverse in which DC Comics
          stories are set. Originally hailing from the world of Earth-Two, first
          envisioned as the home of DC's wartime heroes as published in 1940s
          comic books, Power Girl becomes stranded in the main universe where DC
          stories are set, and becomes acquainted with that world's Superman and
          her own counterpart, Supergirl.

        <h2>Zatanna</h2>
        <img src="Images/ZeeZatara.png" alt="Zee ZeeZatara" />
        <p>
          The character is depicted as a renowned sorceress belonging to the
          fictional Homo magi race, a subset of humans endowed with innate
          potential to manipulate magic. She is also the daughter of Giovanni
          Zatara and Sindella, the former a renowned stage magician and sorcerer
          whom she models herself after and the latter whose lineage connects
          her to the royal line of Atlantis. Zatanna balances her life as a
          international celebrity stage magician and superhero who often fights
          against the forces of evil and serves as both a mystic consultant and
          a notable member of several teams such as the Justice League.

        <h2>Wonder Woman</h2>
        <img src="Images/Wonder Woman.png" alt="Wonder Woman" />
        <p>
          Wonder Woman's most enduring origin story dates from the Golden Age of
          Comic Books, which relays that she was sculpted from clay by her
          mother, Queen Hippolyta, and given a life as an Amazon along with
          superhuman powers as gifts from the Greek gods. Other retellings
          establish her as the biological daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, making
          her a demigod. The character has also changed in her depiction over
          the decades, including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late
          1960s; by the 1980s, artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and
          emphasized her Amazonian heritage. She possesses an arsenal of magical
          items, including the Lasso of Truth, a pair of indestructible
          bracelets, a tiara which serves as a projectile, and, in older
          stories, a range of devices based on Amazon technology.
