      <p>
        Gardening is the process of growing plants for their vegetables, fruits,
        flowers, herbs, and appearances within a designated space.Gardens
        fulfill a wide assortment of purposes, notably the production of
        aesthetically pleasing areas, medicines, cosmetics, dyes, foods,
        poisons, wildlife habitats, and saleable goods. People often partake in
        gardening for its therapeutic, health, educational, cultural,
        philosophical, environmental, and religious benefits.Gardening can be
        difficult to differentiate from farming. They are most easily
        differentiated based on their primary objectives. Farming prioritizes
        saleable goods and may include livestock production whereas gardening
        often prioritizes aesthetics and leisure.As it pertains to food
        production, gardening generally happens on a much smaller scale with the
        intent of personal or community consumption.There are cultures which do
        not differentiate between farming and gardening.This is primarily
        because subsistence agriculture has been the main method of farming
        throughout its 12,000 year history and is virtually indistinguishable
        from gardening.

        Arts and crafts describes a wide variety of activities involving making
        things with one's own hands. Arts and crafts is usually a hobby. Some
        crafts have been practised since preshistoric times, others are more
        recent inventions. William Morris, John Ruskin and others promoted an
        "arts and crafts" movement in the late 19th century, which popularized
        the phrase. Both children and adults enjoy arts and crafts. Children in
        schools may learn skills such as woodworking, wood carving, sewing, or
        making things with all sorts of material. Many community centres and
        schools have evening or day classes and workshops where one can learn
        arts and craft skillsThe Arts and Crafts movement was an international
        trend in the decorative and fine arts that developed earliest and most
        fully in the British Isles and subsequently spread across the British
        Empire and to the rest of Europe and America. Initiated in reaction
        against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts and the
        conditions in which they were produced,the movement flourished in Europe
        and North America between about 1880 and 1920. Some consider that it is
        the root of the Modern Style, a British expression of what later came to
        be called the Art Nouveau movement. Others consider that it is the
        incarnation of Art Nouveau in England.

        Sport is a form of physical activity or game.Often competitive and
        organized, sports use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills.
        They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases,
        entertainment to spectators. Many sports exist, with different
        participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being
        done by hundreds. Most sports take place either in teams or competing as
        individuals. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no
        single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner.
        A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a
        champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranginggames
        in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.Sport is
        generally recognised as system of activities based in physical
        athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions admitting
        only sports meeting this definition.Some organisations, such as the
        Council of Europe, preclude activities without any physical element from
        classification as sports.However, a number of competitive, but
        non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The
        International Olympic Committee who oversee the Olympic Games recognises
        both chess and bridge as sports. SportAccord, the international sports
        federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: chess,
        bridge, draughts, Go and xiangqi.

        Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of symbols,
        often specifically those of a written language, by means of sight or
        touch.For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process
        involving such areas as word recognition, orthography , alphabetics,
        phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and
        motivation.Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms , are
        not based on speech-based writing systems.The common link is the
        interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual
        notations or tactile signalsReading is generally an individual activity,
        done silently, although on occasion a person reads out loud for other
        listeners; or reads aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension.
        Before the reintroduction of separated text in the late Middle Ages, the
        ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable.Major
        predictors of an individual's ability to read both alphabetic and
        non-alphabetic scripts are oral language skills, phonological awareness,
        rapid automatized naming and verbal IQ.As a leisure activity, children
        and adults read because it is enjoyable and interesting. In the US,
        about half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each
        year.About 5% read more than 50 books per year.Americans read more if
        they: have more education, read fluently and easily, are female, live in
        cities, and have higher socioeconomic status.Children become better
        readers when they know more about the world in general, and when they
        perceive reading as fun rather than as a chore to be performed.

      <li>Singing</li>

      <p>
        Singing is the art of creating music with the voice. It is the oldest
        form of musical expression, and the human voice can be considered the
        first musical instrument.The definition of singing varies across
        sources.Some sources define singing as the act of creating musical
        sounds with the voice.Other common definitions include "the utterance of
        words or sounds in tuneful succession" or "the production of musical
        tones by means of the human voice".A person whose profession is singing
        is called a singer or a vocalist.Singers perform music that can be sung
        with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often
        done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir. Singers may perform
        as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument up to a
        symphony orchestra or big band. Many styles of singing exist throughout
        the world.inging can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It
        may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of
        pleasure, comfort, as part of a ritual, during music education or as a
        profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication,
        instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then
        the sounds can become clearer and stronger.Professional singers usually
        build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical
        or rock, although there are singers with crossover success .
        Professional singers typically receive voice training from vocal coaches
        or voice teachers throughout their careers.

        Dance is an art form, consisting of sequences of body movements with
        aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully
        selected. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by
        its repertoire of movements or by its historical period or place of
        origin. Dance is typically performed with musical accompaniment, and
        sometimes with the dancer simultaneously using a musical instrument
        themselves. Two common types of group dance are theatrical and
        participatory dance. Both types of dance may have special functions,
        whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, sacred or
        liturgical. Dance is not solely restricted to performance, as dance is
        used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports
        and activities. Dance performances and dancing competitions are found
        across the world exhibiting various different styles and standards.
        Dance may also be participated in alone as a form of exercise or self
        expression. Dancing is common human behaviour, and does not necessarily
        require specific choreography.
